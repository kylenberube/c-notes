# Variables

# What is a variable?

Variables hold values or a Variable is a name that refers to some data in memory
Easier to read a Variable name than a memory address value
Can't start with a digit 0-9, two underscores, or a underscored followed by a capital letter

# Variable Types

Integer             7           int
Floating Point      3.14535     float
Character           'k'         char
String              "Hello!"    char *

Before using a variable you have to declare it, and assign it a value or it will be Uninitialized(indeterminate values)
Can assume this will be a nonsense number
Need to tell C what type the variable holds & assign it a value

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int k = 7                 // declared the variable type and assigned it a value
    float f = 56.324234       // same here
    char *s = "Hello Linux!"; // char * (char pointer) string type
    
    printf("%s k = %d and f = %f!\n", s, k, f);
}
```
**Output**
` Hello Kyle! k = 7 and f = 56.324234! `
